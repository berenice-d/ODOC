# Ion-channels
Reports, notebooks, and everything else related to my participation in the Kaggle competition "Ion switching" (ending May 2020)
The work was performed in the context of my Springboard capstone projet.

## Overview

The project comprises all steps of Data Science work broken down as follows:
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Machine learning (ensemble models and deep learning)
* Reporting
Data collection and wangling was not necessary as the competition host provided data.
